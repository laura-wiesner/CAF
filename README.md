# Complex Ambiguity Function (CAF) for TDOA/FDOA Analysis

## Overview
This repository houses a Python-based implementation of a complex ambiguity function, pivotal for analyzing Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Frequency Difference of Arrival (FDOA). These techniques are crucial in the field of signal processing and geolocation. The notebook showcases how to apply time and frequency shifts to signals and visualize the results using the ambiguity function.

## Features
- **Complex Ambiguity Function Implementation:** Simulate and visualize TDOA and FDOA on synthetic signals using numpy and matplotlib.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** The notebook includes plots that demonstrate the impact of time and frequency shifts on signal analysis.
- **Efficient Computation:** Utilizes FFT algorithms for efficient computation of shifted signals and their ambiguity functions.
